# Code Quality Rules

1. Test Coverage:
   - Before attempting completion, always make sure that any code changes have test coverage
   - Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes

2. Lint Rules:
   - Never disable any lint rules without explicit user approval
   - If a lint rule needs to be disabled, ask the user first and explain why
   - Prefer fixing the underlying issue over disabling the lint rule
   - Document any approved lint rule disabling with a comment explaining the reason

## Adding a New Setting

                "ALWAYS read `.brain/tasks.md`"
            ]
        },
        "safety_requirements": [

            "ALWAYS maintain proper error handling",
            "ALWAYS document new code",
        ],
        "priorities": [
            {

                "weight": 1.0
            }
        ],
        "modes": {
