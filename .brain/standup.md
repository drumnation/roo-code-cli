## ðŸ”„ Progress Update

### âœ… Completed

- Implemented WebSocket server core functionality
- Added VS Code configuration integration
- Created comprehensive test suite for WebSocket server
- Implemented proper error handling and logging

### ðŸ§  Key Decisions

1. WebSocket Server Design:

    - Used class-based architecture for better state management
    - Implemented event-driven message handling
    - Integrated with VS Code configuration system for port settings

2. Testing Strategy:

    - Created mock VS Code module for configuration testing
    - Used Promise-based tests for asynchronous operations
    - Implemented proper cleanup in test lifecycle hooks

3. Error Handling:
    - Added structured error responses for invalid messages
    - Implemented comprehensive logging for all server events
    - Used TypeScript type guards for better error type handling

### ðŸ’¡ Technical Insights

1. VS Code Integration:

    - Learned proper mocking techniques for VS Code extension APIs
    - Discovered importance of hoisting mock declarations in tests
    - Implemented flexible configuration with defaults

2. WebSocket Testing:

    - Used real WebSocket connections in tests for better coverage
    - Implemented proper server cleanup to prevent port conflicts
    - Added timeout handling for async operations

3. Logging Patterns:
    - Added structured logging for all WebSocket lifecycle events
    - Implemented error context preservation in logs
    - Used JSON formatting for better log parsing

### ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Implement message type validation
2. Add secure WebSocket support (WSS)
3. Implement client message rate limiting
4. Add connection pooling for better scalability

### ðŸ”„ Test Framework Migration

- Successfully migrated websocket-server tests from vitest to @vscode/test-electron
- Implemented proper mocking for WebSocket server and client
- Added better test isolation with proper cleanup between tests
- Improved error handling and validation in tests

### ðŸ§  Technical Insights

1. WebSocket Testing Best Practices:
   - Use proper event handler mocking for WebSocket connections
   - Store and track sent messages for validation
   - Properly clean up server instances between tests
   - Handle port conflicts in test environment

2. VSCode Extension Testing:
   - @vscode/test-electron provides better integration with VSCode's extension host
   - Mocha is the preferred test framework for VSCode extensions
   - Test setup requires proper extension context mocking
   - Important to handle cleanup of test resources

### ðŸ’¡ Key Decisions

1. Chose @vscode/test-electron over vitest for:
   - Better VSCode extension testing support
   - Native integration with VSCode's test runner
   - Improved test stability and reliability
   - Consistent with VSCode extension development best practices

2. Test Architecture Improvements:
   - Implemented proper mock classes with event handling
   - Added state tracking for better test assertions
   - Improved error handling and validation
   - Better test isolation with cleanup
