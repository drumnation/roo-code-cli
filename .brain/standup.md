## ðŸ”„ Progress Update

### âœ… Completed

- Set up isolated websocket-server package with modern tooling
- Implemented robust logging system with Winston
- Added comprehensive test suite using vitest

### ðŸ§  Key Decisions

1. Package Management:

    - Migrated to pnpm for better dependency management
    - Kept websocket-server isolated from main package to avoid upstream conflicts

2. Development Tools:

    - Using tsx for direct TypeScript execution without build step
    - Chose vitest for better TypeScript support and faster test execution
    - Implemented custom synchronous Winston transport for reliable testing

3. Testing Strategy:
    - Using temporary directories for test isolation
    - Implemented synchronous file operations for deterministic tests
    - Added comprehensive test coverage for logger functionality

### ðŸ’¡ Technical Insights

1. Logger Implementation:

    - Created custom SyncFileTransport for reliable file operations
    - Used Winston's format.combine for flexible log formatting
    - Implemented environment-aware console logging

2. Testing Improvements:
    - Discovered and resolved file system race conditions in tests
    - Implemented proper test cleanup to prevent state leakage
    - Used TypeScript's ReturnType utility for better type inference

### ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Implement WebSocket server core functionality
2. Add WebSocket-specific logging patterns
3. Set up integration tests for WebSocket communication
