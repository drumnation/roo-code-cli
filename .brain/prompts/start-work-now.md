1. Review the priority order from context above
2. Begin implementing the highest priority feature:

   # First validate your understanding

   - State the feature you're starting
   - Confirm it's the current highest priority
   - Note any blockers/dependencies

   # Then proceed with implementation

   - Reference relevant rules/patterns
   - Run tests as you develop

Success Requirements:

- âœ… Selected correct highest priority feature
- âœ… No blocking dependencies
- âœ… Clear path to implementation
