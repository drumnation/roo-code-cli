🤖 I need your help to create a comprehensive knowledge rule file on the topic of: **[User inserts the topic/skill here]**.

This knowledge rule file will serve as a foundational resource to instantly equip a Cursor AI agent with deep understanding and practical application capabilities for this concept within our software development ecosystem. The agent will leverage this knowledge as part of a multi-agent system that decomposes software projects using the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principle.

**🧠 Step 0: File Organization and Structure:**

1.  **Directory Analysis:**
    - **🔍 Analyze the `.brain/knowledge` directory hierarchy** to identify the most appropriate location for this knowledge file
    - **📊 Consider existing categorizations and relationships** between knowledge domains
2.  **Location Decision:**
    - **✅ Existing Category:** Place in the most relevant existing folder
    - **🆕 New Category:** Create a new directory using kebab-case (e.g., `domain-specific/`) if the topic represents a distinct knowledge domain
3.  **File Creation:**
    - **📝 Naming Convention:** `topic-name.guide.ts` in kebab-case
    - **🔗 File Type:** TypeScript module with exported constant
    - **📚 Documentation:** Include JSDoc comments for better IDE integration

**❗ Important Considerations:**

- **Prioritize Accuracy:** Emphasize the importance of providing up-to-date information, referencing official documentation, and cross-referencing multiple sources. The AI should add notes about potential outdated information and include the current date.
- **Maximize Depth and Breadth:** **Explicitly instruct the AI to cover a wide range of subtopics, best practices, and advanced techniques. Remind the AI to provide extensive explanations and details in each section, aiming for a comprehensive and in-depth treatment of the topic.**
- **Encourage Detailed Examples:** **Instruct the AI to provide numerous, detailed, and practical examples, including variations, edge cases, and well-commented code snippets.**
- **Consistency:** While allowing flexibility, encourage the AI to maintain a generally consistent structure across rule files for easier processing.
- **Code Examples:** Use `inline code formatting` for short snippets within descriptions, or use the dedicated `"codeExamples"` array with `language` and `code` properties for larger, multi-line code blocks. Add detailed inline comments to code examples.
- **MECE Structure:** Remind the AI to strive for a MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) organization of concepts where appropriate, especially when breaking down steps and actions.
- **Error Handling:** Encourage the AI to include examples or guidance on error handling when applicable.
- **Validation:** You might want to implement some basic validation checks after the AI generates a rule file to ensure that the essential elements are present and that the structure is generally sound.
