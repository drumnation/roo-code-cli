## Agent Task: Identify a Critical Knowledge Gap for Breaking Through a Development Loop

**Context:**

We are currently experiencing a development roadblock in our software project, specifically related to **{TOPIC}**. Our team seems to be stuck in a loop, making no significant progress despite repeated attempts. We need to identify a critical knowledge gap that, if addressed, could potentially break us out of this loop. We need you to pinpoint a specific, actionable topic for which we should create a new knowledge file to solve this.

**Objective:**

Your task is to analyze the current situation and propose a **single, focused topic** for a new knowledge file. This topic should:

1.  **Directly address the core issue:** It must be relevant to the current problem of being stuck in a loop regarding {TOPIC}.
2.  **Offer new insights:** The topic should go beyond our current understanding and potentially uncover hidden assumptions, overlooked patterns, or missing information.
3.  **Be actionable:** The knowledge gained from this file should lead to concrete steps we can take to move forward.
4.  **Be tailored for knowledge file creation:** The topic must be suitable for detailed documentation in the format defined by our existing knowledge file creation prompt.
5.  **Suggest a specific solution.** It would be helpful if you could suggest a specific library, pattern, or approach we are not currently using to solve the problem.

**Specific Questions to Consider:**

- **Root Cause Analysis:** What are the potential underlying reasons for our lack of progress related to {TOPIC}? Consider factors like incomplete understanding of core concepts, incorrect implementation of patterns, or misuse of tools.
- **Information Gaps:** What specific information are we missing that could shed light on the issue? Are there any areas within {TOPIC} where our knowledge is outdated or incomplete?
- **Alternative Approaches:** Are there alternative libraries, design patterns, or methodologies related to {TOPIC} that we haven't explored? Could a different perspective or technique be the key to breaking the loop?
- **Debugging and Diagnostics:** Are there specific debugging tools or diagnostic techniques relevant to {TOPIC} that we might be overlooking? Could a better understanding of error messages or performance bottlenecks point us in the right direction?
- **Specific Library or Pattern:** Is there a specific library, framework, or design pattern that is commonly used to address challenges similar to ours in the context of {TOPIC}?

**Output:**

Please provide your response in the following format:

```json
{
	"recommendedTopic": "Precise topic suitable for the knowledge file creation prompt",
	"justification": "A concise explanation of why this topic is crucial and how it addresses the identified issues.",
	"expectedOutcome": "A description of the specific benefits and insights we expect to gain from creating a knowledge file on this topic.",
	"suggestedApproach": "A specific suggestion for how to move forward, such as using a new library or pattern. Explain why this might work."
}
```

**Example Output (Illustrative):**

```json
{
	"recommendedTopic": "Advanced State Management with Redux Toolkit and Async Thunks in React",
	"justification": "Our current state management approach seems to be causing complexity and hindering our ability to debug asynchronous operations effectively. Redux Toolkit, with its simplified API and async thunk capabilities, could offer a more robust and maintainable solution, potentially resolving the issues we're facing with data flow and side effects.",
	"expectedOutcome": "A knowledge file on this topic will provide a deep understanding of Redux Toolkit's features, best practices for handling asynchronous actions, and strategies for integrating it into our existing React application. This should lead to a more streamlined and predictable state management system, potentially breaking us out of the current loop.",
	"suggestedApproach": "We should try implementing a small feature using Redux Toolkit and its createAsyncThunk utility. This will allow us to evaluate its effectiveness and identify any potential integration challenges. Switching to Redux Toolkit might resolve the issues we have with handling asynchronous actions, potentially simplifying data flow and breaking the loop."
}
```

**Important Notes:**

- **Replace {TOPIC}** with the actual topic where you're experiencing the loop.
- The example output is just an illustration. Your agent's response will depend on the specific context you provide.
- **Emphasis on Specificity:** Encourage the agent to be as specific as possible in its topic recommendation. The more precise the topic, the more effective the resulting knowledge file will be.
- **Actionable Output:** The goal is to get a topic that's ready to be plugged into your knowledge file creation prompt, minimizing further back-and-forth.

This refined prompt should help you elicit a much more targeted and useful response from your agent, ultimately leading to the creation of a knowledge file that helps you break free from the development loop.
